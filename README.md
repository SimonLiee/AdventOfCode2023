My solutions to AoC 2023 in Rust. This is one of my first times using rust so the code will most likely not be great.

## How to run
cargo run "example" "day" "part"

Set example to 1 to run with example input or 0 for full input.
Set day to specify which day to run.
Set part to specify what part to run.
